# EcoScan

## Project Overview

EcoScan is an iOS application designed to empower consumers to make environmentally conscious purchasing decisions. By scanning a product's barcode, the app provides an instant, science-based Eco-Score, analyzing factors such as packaging sustainability, carbon footprint, and ethical certifications. The goal is to translate complex environmental data into an actionable metric for everyday use.

## Project Structure

The application is built using SwiftUI and follows a modular structure for maintainability and clarity.

## Core Features

-   **Instant Product Scanning**: Utilizes the device's camera via `BarcodeScanner.swift` to quickly read barcodes.
-   **Scientific Eco-Score**: Each product receives a score generated by a proprietary algorithm within `ProductService.swift`, evaluating its environmental impact.
-   **Detailed Breakdown**: The `ScoreBreakdownView` presents a granular analysis of the score components.
-   **Impact Tracking**: The `ImpactMetricsView` on the home dashboard visualizes the user's cumulative positive environmental impact.
-   **Product History**: Users can review past scans in the `ScanHistoryView`.
-   **User Profile & Settings**: Supports user accounts and allows customization of data sources, such as setting the API location via `APILocationView`.

## Technical Implementation

The frontend is built natively with **SwiftUI**, ensuring a responsive and modern iOS interface. Application logic is compartmentalized into services for separation of concerns. The app integrates with external data sources, such as the Open Food Facts database, through dedicated service classes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   Xcode 13.0 or later
-   iOS 15.0 or later
-   A physical iOS device with a camera (recommended for full testing) or a simulator with camera permissions configured.

### Installation
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open `EcoScan.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3.  Select your target device or simulator.
4.  Build and run the project (Cmd+R).

### Configuration
Key API endpoints and application settings are managed in `App/Config/AppConfig.swift`. Ensure you review this file to configure any necessary service keys or environment-specific variables before running the app.

## Usage

1.  Launch the EcoScan app.
2.  Create an account or log in via the `Authentication` views.
3.  From the `HomeView`, navigate to the `ScannerView`.
4.  Position a product barcode within the camera overlay to scan.
5.  View the immediate Eco-Score and detailed breakdown in the `ProductResultView`.
6.  Track your long-term impact and review scan history from the respective tabs.

## Development

This project was developed as a hackathon submission, focusing on creating a functional prototype that demonstrates the core concept of data-driven sustainable consumerism. The codebase is structured to be clear and extensible for future development, such as enhancing the scoring algorithm or integrating additional data providers.
